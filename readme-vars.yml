  We don't formally support upgrading from Airsonic to Airsonic Advanced, it may or may not work for you and we'd recommend making backups before attempting this.

  Please see notes about upgrading from v10 to v11 [here](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced#usage)

  Access WebUI at `<your-ip>:4040`.

  Default user/pass is admin/admin

  Extra java options can be passed with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, eg `-e JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx256m -Xms256m"`. For some reverse proxies, you may need to pass `JAVA_OPTS=-Dserver.use-forward-headers=true` for airsonic to generate the proper URL schemes.

  Note that if you want to use [Airsonic's Java jukebox player](https://airsonic.github.io/docs/jukebox/), then `PGID` will need to match the group of your sound device (e.g. `/dev/snd`).
